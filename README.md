## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to analyze raw HTTP server log data to uncover usage patterns, request types, response behavior, and user activity. This project was part of a data-focused interview task and aims to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world logs, apply Python-based parsing techniques, and generate meaningful insights with visualizations.

## ✅ Tasks Solved

1. Extract the host that made the request
2. Extract and format the timestamp
3. Extract HTTP method, requested file, and protocol
4. Extract status code and number of bytes
5. Count total requests
6. Count distinct hosts
7. Top 10 requested files
8. 📊 Hourly distribution of requests (Bar chart added!)
9. 📊 Status code distribution (Bar chart added!)
10. 📊 Most frequent hosts (Bar chart added!)

## 📈 Visualizations

Every applicable question includes clear and labeled bar charts to support the analysis. These help demonstrate distribution, patterns, and top elements in the dataset.

---

## 🔍 Insights & Observations

- Majority of requests used the **GET** method.
- Most traffic occurred between **13:00 and 17:00 hours**.
- Certain files like `index.html` were requested disproportionately more.
- The server responded with **status code 200 (OK)** most frequently.
- Top hosts are repeat visitors, indicating frequent users or bots.

---

## 📌 Notes for Reviewer

- The notebook runs cleanly in **Google Colab**
- Code includes simple comments and explanations
- All analysis is self-contained with input/output shown clearly
- Charts improve readability and interpretation

## 💡 Conclusion

This project simulates a real-world log analysis task, where understanding and parsing raw data is the first step before deeper modeling or dashboarding. It reflects my attention to detail, logic-building skills, and ability to communicate findings effectively.
